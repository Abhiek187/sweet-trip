# Sweet Trip

This game was created at Make School during their hackathon. For one week, our goal was to create a game based on a few random items. In my case, I was given a cookie 🍪, a person 🧑, and a spaceship 🚀. The result was Sweet Trip, a game I had more fun making than I expected. This app would later inspire me to create [Captain Conundrum](https://github.com/Abhiek187/Captain-Conundrum), my more fully-fledged iOS game created in Make School.
