# Sweet Trip

![Sweet Trip demo](demo-sweet-trip.gif)

This game was created at Make School during their hackathon. For one week, our goal was to create a game based on a few random items. In my case, I was given a cookie 🍪, a person 🧑, and a spaceship 🚀. The result was Sweet Trip, a game I had more fun making than I expected. Your goal is to collect as many cookies as you can as you perpetually move to the right to save your special one. This app would later inspire me to create [Captain Conundrum](https://github.com/Abhiek187/Captain-Conundrum), my more fully-fledged iOS game created in Make School.
